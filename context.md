## Context

In extreme cold weather, living organisms produce Antifreeze Proteins (AFPs) to counter the otherwise lethal intracellular formation of ice. Structures and sequences of various AFPs exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, consequently the prediction of the AFPs is considered to be a challenging task. In this research, we propose to handle this arduous manifold learning task using the notion of localized processing. In particular an AFP sequence is segmented into two sub-segments each of which is analyzed for amino acid and di-peptide compositions. 

We propose to use only the most significant features using the concept of information gain (IG) followed by a random forest classification approach. The proposed RAFP-Pred achieved an excellent performance on a number of standard datasets. 



We report a high **Youdenâ€™s index** (sensitivity+specificity-1) value of **0.75** on the standard independent test data set outperforming the AFP-PseAAC, AFP PSSM, AFP-Pred and iAFP by a margin of 0.05, 0.06, 0.14 and 0.68 respectively. 



The **verification rate** on the UniProKB dataset is found to be **83.19%** which is substantially superior to the 57.18% reported for the iAFP method.
